# BarangayCARE - Supabase Database Integration

## Overview

The BarangayCARE system now uses **Supabase** as the cloud database to store all complaints permanently. This ensures:

âœ… **Multi-user access** - All users can access their complaints from any device  
âœ… **Admin visibility** - Admins can view and manage ALL complaints from all users  
âœ… **Cloud synchronization** - Data is stored in Supabase and syncs across devices  
âœ… **Real-time updates** - Changes appear instantly across all connected devices  
âœ… **Permanent storage** - Data never gets deleted, even after refresh/restart

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Database Setup Script

1. Open your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Click **"New Query"**
4. Copy and paste the contents of `/utils/supabase/setup-database.sql`
5. Click **"Run"** to execute

**Note:** If you already ran the old version and are getting permission errors, run `/utils/supabase/fix-policies.sql` to fix the RLS policies.

### Step 2: Enable Realtime

1. Go to **Database** â†’ **Replication**
2. Find the `complaints` table
3. Toggle **ON** for realtime updates

### Step 3: Set Up Admin User

1. Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Users**
2. Click on your admin user
3. Under **"User Metadata"**, add:
   ```json
   {
     "role": "admin",
     "name": "Admin Name"
   }
   ```
4. Save changes

### Step 4: Test the Integration

1. Log in to the application
2. Submit a test complaint
3. Check the Supabase **Table Editor** to verify the data is saved
4. Log in as admin to verify you can see all complaints
5. Update a complaint status and verify it syncs in real-time

---

## How It Works

### For Regular Users:
- Users can **submit complaints** from any device
- Their complaints are **permanently stored** in Supabase
- They can **view their own complaints** across all devices
- **Real-time updates** show status changes immediately
- Data is **never lost**, even after clearing browser cache

### For Admins:
- Admins can **view ALL complaints** from all users
- They can **update status, priority, and add notes**
- Changes sync **instantly** to users
- Complete **history and audit trail** is maintained
- Can **filter and search** across all complaints

### Security (Row Level Security):
- Users can only see their own complaints
- Users can only create complaints for themselves
- Admins can see and modify all complaints
- All actions are tied to authenticated users
- Unauthorized access is automatically blocked

---

## Real-Time Synchronization

The system uses **Supabase Realtime** to sync data across devices:

- When a user submits a complaint â†’ Admins see it **instantly**
- When admin updates status â†’ User sees it **immediately**
- When priority is changed â†’ All connected devices update **in real-time**
- No page refresh needed â†’ Updates appear **automatically**

This is achieved through WebSocket subscriptions that listen for database changes.

---

## Data Migration (Optional)

If you have existing complaints in localStorage:

1. The **MigrationHelper** component will automatically appear
2. Click **"Migrate to Cloud"** to transfer data
3. All local complaints will be uploaded to Supabase
4. Data becomes accessible from any device

Alternatively, users can re-submit their complaints after database setup.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Complaints not appearing
**Solution:**
- Verify you're logged in
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure RLS policies are set up correctly
- Verify your Supabase connection in `/utils/supabase/info.tsx`

### Problem: "Permission denied" errors
**Solution:**
- Check that RLS policies are created
- Verify user is authenticated
- For admins: Ensure `role: "admin"` is in user metadata

### Problem: Real-time not working
**Solution:**
- Enable Realtime in Database â†’ Replication
- Check browser console for subscription errors
- Verify Supabase project settings allow realtime

### Problem: Can't submit complaints
**Solution:**
- Ensure table exists (check Table Editor)
- Verify user is logged in
- Check that INSERT policy is active
- Look for errors in browser console

---

## Database Maintenance

### Backup
- Supabase automatically backs up your database
- You can also export data from Table Editor

### Performance
- Indexes are automatically created for common queries
- Realtime subscriptions are optimized for low latency

### Monitoring
- Check **Database** â†’ **Query Performance** in Supabase
- Monitor logs in **Logs** â†’ **Database**

## API Usage

The complaint manager automatically handles all database operations:

```typescript
// Add a complaint
const { error } = await addComplaint({
  title: "Pothole on Main Street",
  description: "Large pothole needs repair",
  category: "infrastructure",
  location: "Main Street",
  contactInfo: "user@example.com",
  status: "pending",
  priority: "medium"
});

// Update a complaint (admin)
await updateComplaint(complaintId, {
  status: "in-progress",
  priority: "high",
  adminNotes: "Scheduled for repair next week"
});

// Fetch complaints (automatic)
// The system automatically fetches complaints on load
// and subscribes to real-time updates
```

---

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Run the database setup script in Supabase SQL Editor
2. âœ… Enable realtime for the complaints table
3. âœ… Set up at least one admin user
4. âœ… Test submitting a complaint
5. âœ… Verify data appears in Supabase Table Editor
6. âœ… Test admin viewing and updating complaints
7. âœ… Verify real-time sync works
8. âœ… (Optional) Migrate localStorage data if needed
